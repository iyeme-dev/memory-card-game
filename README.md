# Rationale
The Memory Card Game is a simple matching game that challenges players to flip and match pairs of cards within a 60-second time limit. With just a tap, users can start the game, flip cards, and attempt to find all matching pairs before time runs out. Clean and uncluttered, the game’s simple interface ensures both children and adults can enjoy a playful brain exercise without distractions. 

### Target Audience
Puzzle & Brain Game Lovers – Users who enjoy challenges that test memory and concentration.
Teachers & Parents – Those seeking an engaging, simple game for children that can help improve their memory while keeping them entertained.
Students – People who want to practice focus and short-term memory skills.
Busy Professionals – Users looking for a short, stress-relieving break during work hours.

### Motivation
The Memory Card Game was created to solve common problems that many game lovers experience. From the user stories above, we can identify the following pain points;
-Some games take too much time with registration and sign-up processes
-Some games are not responsive on mobile phones which could be frustrating for users when they are out and about.
-Players might feel frustrated if they have to manually reload the page to start a new game. 
-Without accessible instructions, users can feel confused, hesitant, or potentially abandon the game before giving it a fair try
-Without positive, immediate feedback, players may not be motivated to carry on with the game
-If the game is too complex, children may loose interest
-Cluttered game layout, which could be distracting or confusing

This game was therefore designed to provide a fun, simple, and engaging way to improve memory and concentration while having fun. It offers clear instructions, restart functionality, and instant feedback on wins or losses. The goal is to deliver a clean, interactive, and accessible game experience for both children and adults.
